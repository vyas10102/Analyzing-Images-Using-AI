# Analyzing Food Dishes Using AI: A Comparison of Bing AI and OpenAI Image Recognition

## Acknowledgment 

This blog post was done by Ritwika Das (GWID: G30941802) and Aditi Vyas (GWID: G40802010) under the guidnace of Professor Robert Pless.

## Overview

This project explores the capabilities of AI-powered image recognition tools—specifically Bing AI and OpenAI—in identifying food items from an image featuring a variety of dishes. The blog post compares the performance of both platforms based on their confidence levels and accuracy in identifying different foods such as Pho, dumplings, and sushi rolls.

## Blog Post

You can read the full blog post on the file uploaded. The post includes detailed analysis, screenshots, and a comparison of the confidence levels for each identified dish.

## Project Structure

- **/images** – Contains the food image used for the AI analysis.
- **/results** – Stores the AI output, including the confidence levels for each identified food item.
- **/scripts** – Includes any code or automation used to interact with the AI tools and gather the results.

## Key Findings

- **Bing AI**: Higher confidence in certain dishes, with detailed identification of ingredients like chili peppers and grilled skewers.
- **OpenAI**: Slightly lower confidence levels but identified additional items like sweet potato fries and yellow curry.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-image-ai-analysis.git
2. **Explore the Blog Post**:  
   ```bash
   Navigate to the blog_post.md or link directly to the blog post hosted on GitHub Pages or a blog platform.
3. **Check AI Results**:  
   ```bash
   The /results folder contains the detailed outputs from both AI platforms.
   
## Requirements

If you’re planning to replicate the experiment, you’ll need:

- An account with Bing AI and OpenAI to run image recognition queries.
